# 🚨 Cloud Incident Response & Host Forensics Lab

This project simulates enterprise-grade incident response practices in a hybrid environment, modeled after Airbus Defence and Space operations. It includes SIEM alert triage, host memory forensics, reverse engineering, and detection rule development.

## 🔍 Key Features
- SOC alert analysis using Splunk and Elastic SIEM
- Host-based forensic investigation (Volatility, Sysmon)
- Reverse engineering malware behavior (CyberChef)
- Custom Sigma and YARA rule development
- CJCSM 6510.01B-aligned incident documentation

## 📁 File Structure
- `incident_report.pdf` – Complete RCA, IoCs, and MITRE mapping
- `detection_rules/` – Custom Sigma and YARA rules
- `memory_analysis/` – Volatility analysis results
- `sop_templates/` – IR SOPs aligned with CJCSM
- `malware_sample_reversing/` – Binary analysis and decoding

## 🛠 Tools & Standards
Splunk, Volatility, CyberChef, Sigma, Sysmon, Elastic SIEM, MITRE ATT&CK, YARA, AWS (simulated), CJCSM 6510.01B
